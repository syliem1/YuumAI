You’ve also gotten roughly ${stats.avg_solo_kills} solo kills per game as well as an average of ${stats.avg_kills_near_tower} kills near enemy tower.

Demacians are known for working together to destroy their enemies while making sure to keep their allies safe. Your average kill participation, ${stats.avg_kill_participation}, and your teamfight damage, ${stats.avg_team_damage_pct}, are exceptionally high, but your average shielding on allies, ${stats.avg_shields_on_teammates}, proves that you know your teammates come first.`,

The scars from Noxus linger on Ionia’s once peaceful lands, and now Ionians are ready for anything. To be an Ionian, you must be sharp and quick-witted if you want to stay alive. Ionians typically have exceptional cs and kill participation while also maintaining a high KDA. They are also known to be one with the land around them, meaning that they on average achieve a stellar vision score.

The hunt brings in food, pays for shelter, and can save lives. Hunting the monsters in Ixtal can provide several benefits, such as honing your skills, immense amounts of meat, and special boons. A good jungler translates very easily into being an excellent hunter. Getting a high amount of dragon and herald kills per game means that you are a valuable asset to your team’s probability of success. Your high objective damage, ${stats.avg_objective_damage}, paired with high dragon and herald kills, ${stats.avg_dragon_takedowns}, ${stats.avg_herald_takedowns}, exhibits how hard of a jungle carry you can be.`,

Since your cs per minute, ${stats.avg_cs_per_min}, and your cs consistency, ${stats.cs_consistency}, are always exceptionally high, your gold per minute, ${stats.avg_gpm}, goes beyond the average Piltovian salary.

To climb this mountain alone, however, is a death sentence; this climb encourages people to seek out unlikely allies to forge strong bonds that can soldier through the mountain's harsh conditions. Teamwork alone isn’t the only thing that’s needed; a summoner’s individual support skills like warding, healing, and shielding are necessary for the uncertain path ahead. Your average vision score per game, ${stats.avg_vision_score}, demonstrates a perceptive and cautious player. Your average healing and shielding, ${stats.avg_heals_on_teammates}, ${stats.avg_shields_on_teammates}, on teammates is massive.

Iceborn have retained skills such as having insanely long crowd control chains while being an unscalable wall to anyone who dares challenge them. Your stats show that you apply an exceptionally long amount of crowd control, ${stats.avg_cc_time}, to your enemies. You also have an exceptional will to survive which is shown through how long you’ve survived, ${stats.death_consistency}, during each game. You are a true Iceborn.`,

A high average damage per minute accompanied with a high amount of solo kills and teamfight damage. Your high average damage per minute, ${stats.avg_dpm}, identifies you as a fearsome enemy that can tear through the enemy frontline. Your teamfight damage, ${stats.avg_team_damage_pct}, and your solo kills, ${stats.avg_solo_kills}, per game prove that you are an unstoppable force alone and with your team`,

The good people of Zaun have adapted to this lifestyle, putting their life on the line in order to eliminate as many of their enemies as possible. Zaunites typically have a high number of deaths but manage to take down at least one or more enemy players with them. Your average deaths, ${stats.death_consistency}, are quite high, however, you manage to take down around ${stats.avg_outnumbered_kills} champions before you fall. The average amount of assassinations you perform on enemy champions are roughly ${stats.avg_pick_kills} which means your map awareness is exemplary.`,
